            <p>About Dan WEIBREN
I’m Dan — an ex-chef turned developer. Tech was always part of my kitchen, from modern cooking techniques to a custom-built recipe manager I hacked together. Now I’m diving into full-stack development with the same focus and obsession. I’m married to my amazing wife Adi, who supports me through every debugging spiral. Still love food.            </p>
