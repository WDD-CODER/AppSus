            <h2>About Lioz</h2>
            <p>I’m Lioz — I’ve spent the last several years working in my family’s cooling systems business, building and maintaining industrial tech.
                 Lately, I’ve been looking for something new, something I can build with my brain more than my hands.
                 That’s what brought me to coding — a different kind of logic, same satisfaction when things finally click.
                 I'm married to Chen +2 adorable kids.
